# MiningClient-prog

The Standalone Client for our bigger Mining Project

This is the very simple script required to run the Client without any Server

```lua
miningClientSmall config
```

to setup the Libary in the Console.
Very much WIP.

So far only the Scanning-Radius & Mining-Diameteris are relevant
